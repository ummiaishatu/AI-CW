# Defence Against Trojan Attacks on Deep Neural Networks <br> Open using the Python Jupyter Notebook

A recent trojan attack on deep neural network (DNN) models is one insidious variant of data poisoning attacks. Trojan attacks exploit an effective backdoor created in a DNN model by leveraging the difficulty in interpretability of the learned model to misclassify any inputs signed with the attackerâ€™s chosen trojan trigger. Since the trojan trigger is a secret guarded and exploited by the attacker, detecting such trojan inputs is a challenge, especially at run-time when models are in active operation. <br><br> This work builds STRong Intentional Perturbation (STRIP) based run-time trojan attack detection system focusing on vision system, and identifies its strengths and weaknesses.
<br>Every step in the programme has been explained using comments. <br>
This includes the attack strategy and the defense strategy.
